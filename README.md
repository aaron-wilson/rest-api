## Overview

This repository implements a REST API using **Bun** as the runtime and **Hono** as the TypeScript-first framework. It provides a type-safe, high-performance, and maintainable backend with AWS integration for database, authentication, and deployment.

Key features:

* Fully typed REST routes with Hono and Zod validation
* OpenAPI spec generation for documentation and client SDKs
* Scalable AWS DynamoDB data layer with TypeScript DTOs
* Cognito JWT authentication middleware
* Built-in rate limiting, CORS, and input validation
* Unit, integration, and e2e testing with Vitest, Supertest, and Playwright
* CI/CD pipeline deploying Docker images to ECS Fargate via GitHub Actions and AWS CDK
* Observability using OpenTelemetry and New Relic

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate credentials
* Node.js (for local compatibility testing)
* Docker (for containerized development/testing)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rest-api.git
cd rest-api

# Install dependencies with Bun
bun install

# Start local server (hot reload supported)
bun run dev
```

* API playground available at `http://localhost:3000`
* Hot-reloads on code changes
* Environment variables auto-loaded from `.env`

---

## Configuration

Store sensitive or environment-specific configuration in `.env` or AWS Secrets Manager/Parameter Store. Example `.env`:

```env
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME=my-table
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your-user-pool-id
RATE_LIMIT=100
CORS_ORIGIN=*
```

TypeScript DTOs ensure runtime safety and predictable structure.

---

## Database

* **AWS DynamoDB** with **DocumentClient** for flexible, schema-less storage.
* TypeScript DTOs enforce type-safe requests/responses.
* Supports atomic updates, conditional writes, and high scalability.

```ts
import { DynamoDBClient, GetItemCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
```

---

## Authentication & Security

* **Cognito JWT verification middleware** secures endpoints.
* **Rate limiting** and **CORS** protect API from abuse.
* **Zod validation** ensures correct input/output data.

```ts
app.use(jwtMiddleware({ userPoolId: process.env.COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID }));
```

---

## Testing

* **Unit Tests**: Vitest ensures isolated function-level validation.
* **Integration Tests**: Supertest verifies REST API endpoints.
* **E2E Tests**: Playwright handles full-stack scenarios combining frontend and REST API.

```bash
# Run all unit tests
bun run vitest
```

---

## CI/CD

* **GitHub Actions** automates build, test, and Docker image creation.
* Deploys to **AWS ECS Fargate** behind an **ALB**.
* **AWS CDK** manages infrastructure: clusters, services, task definitions, and log groups.

```yaml
# Example CI step
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun run vitest
      - run: docker build -t my-api .
      - run: cdk deploy
```

---

## Observability

* **OpenTelemetry** collects logs, metrics, and traces.
* **New Relic** dashboards monitor API performance, errors, and latency.
